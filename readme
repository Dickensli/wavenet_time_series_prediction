generate_data.py: generate the data we need to test the model
data_reader.py: read the data to feed the model
ops.py: the function used in wavenet
wave.py: the network of wavenet
base_model.py: the father class of WaveNetModel, we use it to train and test the network
we test using predict_incre() which implements fast wavenet algorithm
pic.py: plot the figure of predict and label
